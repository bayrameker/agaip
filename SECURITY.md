The Agaip team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### 📧 How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing: **security@agaip.dev**

Include the following information in your report:
- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### 🕐 Response Timeline

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within **48 hours** and will send a more detailed response within **7 days** indicating the next steps in handling your report.

After the initial reply to your report, we will:
- Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions
- Audit code to find any potential similar problems
- Prepare fixes for all supported versions
- Release patched versions as soon as possible

### 🏆 Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help keep our community safe. With your permission, we will:
- Credit you in our security advisory
- Add you to our security researchers hall of fame
- Provide a reference letter if requested

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version of Agaip
2. **Secure Configuration**: 
   - Use strong, unique API keys
   - Enable HTTPS in production
   - Configure proper CORS settings
   - Use environment variables for secrets
3. **Network Security**: 
   - Use firewalls to restrict access
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Monitor for unusual activity
4. **Database Security**:
   - Use strong database passwords
   - Enable database encryption
   - Regularly backup data

### For Developers

1. **Code Security**:
   - Follow secure coding practices
   - Validate all inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Implement proper error handling
2. **Dependencies**:
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Use tools like `safety` to check for vulnerabilities
   - Pin dependency versions in production
3. **Authentication**:
   - Implement proper session management
   - Use secure password hashing
   - Enable multi-factor authentication where possible

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### API Security
- All API endpoints require authentication
- Rate limiting is implemented by default
- Input validation is performed on all endpoints

### Plugin Security
- Plugins run in the same process as the main application
- Only install trusted plugins
- Review plugin code before installation

### Database Security
- Database connections use connection pooling
- SQL injection protection through ORM
- Sensitive data should be encrypted at rest
